Client project developed by Yan Gorshtenin.

This calendar application is very flexible and has many options. Adding items to the calendar is very easy and quick. Unlike other calendar solutions this calendar is very versatile and for every event you have many fields to fill in (optionally) and you can even create own custom edit dialog fields. Drag and drop is possible and also clicking and selecting dates in the calendar views.
An admin can assign items to employees easily.

You can schedule employees to several calendars/spaces (rooms, shops etc.) or you can do it the other way around; add the employees as calendars and assign spaces to them for Green House.

It’s a complete JavaScript calendar system, with the base jQuery Fullcalendar, Bootstrap and a PHP/MySQL backend.

All Fullcalendar options can be set from the dashboard, you don’t have to go in the code yourself as Yan already did.

The calendar can be accessed with a login, on IP address or public use for everybody at your restaurant.
